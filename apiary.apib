# Signifyd API
# **DEPRECATED** 

> :warning: V2 of our API is deprecated; if you are a new merchant, please refer to **[our V3 API Docs](https://docs.signifyd.com/)** instead. :warning:

## Deprecation Notice
The docs below are for Signifyd's V2 API, which is now **deprecated**.  If you are a new Signifyd customer, your Implementation Manager will recommend that you deploy our V3 API, which will allow you to take advantage of new features and products.  By the end of **Q1 2023**, the V3 docs will become our default API documentation.  Legacy V2 integrations will continue to be supported.


## Overview

This document will show you how to use our REST API to authenticate, make requests, and retrieve data. All responses to and from the API will be in [JSON](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_data_types.htm).

You can view a [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUE-Othaf2c&feature=youtu.be) on how to send and fetch data using the Signifyd API. 

If you are a Signifyd customer and would like to access Enterprise API documentation, please [log in here](https://app.signifyd.com) and navigate to the Resource Center within Developer Tools.

## Authentication
All API requests must be made over HTTPS using a [base64 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) API key. You can generate an API key by creating a team in [settings](https://app.signifyd.com/settings) page.

- Authentication: [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side).
- Username: Your API key as the basic auth username. 
- Password: You do not need to provide a password. However, some REST clients expect a username:password pair separated by a colon. If so, you can use a colon as the password.

## REST Client
Our API docs include a built-in REST console you can use to interactively test the API. Each endpoint is configured with example request data that will produce a successful result from our API if you provide valid credentials. By default, the API key in the REST console is `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` which appears in it's base64 encoded form, `YWJjZGVmZ2hpamtsbW5vcHFyc3R1dnd4eXo6`. You must replace this with you own base64 encoded API key in the headers section of the console to successfully submit requests.

## Response Codes
We use conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, invalid syntax, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Signifyd's servers.

| Code| Description |
| --- | --- |
|`200`| Success - Request completed. |
|`201`| Success - New resource created. |
|`202`| Success - The request has been accepted, but not yet processed. |
|`204`| Success - No content to return. |
|`400`| Bad Request - The request could not be parsed, generally due to bad syntax. |
|`401`| Unauthorized - The request could not be authenticated due to missing or invalid credentials. |
|`403`| Forbidden - You do not have permission to access to the resource. |
|`404`| Not Found - The resource doesn't exist. |
|`409`| Conflict - The with state of the resource on server. Can occur with (too rapid) PUT requests. |
|`429`| The request was not accepted because the application has exceeded the rate limit. APIs that have rate limits are specified in the API documentation. |
|`500`| Internal Server Error - An internal error occurred in Signifyd. |
|`503`| Service Unavailable - The server is currently unavailable. Check the status page for reported outages. |
|`504`| Gateway Timeout - The request could not complete in time. |


## Error Messages
There are two types of errors returned by the API server in the bodies of 4xx and 5xx responses:
- Field-specific errors
- General error messages

```
{
  "errors": {
    "fieldName":[
      "Field-specific error message, e.g., fieldName is not a valid email address."
    ]
  },
  "messages": [
    "General error message."
  ]
}
```

## Dates
Our API uses the [ISO8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format for
complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and timezone offset.

```
         yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ
For UTC: 2015-11-03T13:21:58+00:00
For PST: 2015-11-03T13:21:58-08:00
```
For more information about your specific programming language, please view [this document](https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/reference/datetime-formatting).

## Unique IDs
Signifyd’s Unique IDs, such as caseId and transactionId,leverage the JSON integer type, which has a maximum value of 2 ^ 53 - 1 as mentioned in [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259)


## Backwards Compatibility
Signifyd treats the following API changes as backwards compatible:
- Adding new optional request parameter(s) to an existing API endpoint.
- Adding a new value to an enum field.
- Adding new fields to existing API responses.
- Changing the order of fields in an existing API response.
- Adding a brand new API resource.
- Adding a new webhook event. Your integration should handle unfamiliar webhook events gracefully.
- Changing the length of UUIDs (though we don't change lengths that often!).
- Changing the format of error messages, and other human readable strings.

## Group Guarantees
A guarantee is a financial liability shift that protects online retailers in case of chargebacks. View our product manual to [learn more](https://www.signifyd.com/resources/manual/signifyd-guarantee/signifyd-guarantee/). 

*Guarantee APIs require a case or investigation id which is only provided when [creating a case](https://jsapi.apiary.io/apis/signifydapi/reference/cases/create-a-case/create-case.html).*

A Guarantee can be canceled for orders that no longer require a guarantee. Example: Your customer cancels the order and you issue a refund, you run out of stock for the ordered item, or you cancel the order. 

*Your account will be credited for any canceled guarantees. You cannot cancel a guarantee that has been declined or after 30 days of submission.*

## Group Webhooks

Webhooks are messages sent by SIGNIFYD via HTTP POST to a url you configure on your [Notifications](https://app.signifyd.com/settings/notifications) page in the SIGNIFYD settings.
Webhook messages are sent when certain events occur in the life of an investigation. They allow your application to
receive pushed updates about an investigation, rather than poll SIGNIFYD for status changes. 


### Webhook Events
You can create webhooks in Signifyd for the following events. Each event has a corresponding topic identifier
which will be sent in the `X-SIGNIFYD-TOPIC` header of the webhook.

Currently, the following events can trigger a webhook. Only one URL may be specified per event.

| Event| `X-SIGNIFYD-TOPIC` | Description | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Decision Made | `decisions/*` | Sent anytime a decision is made on a case (guarantee or recommendation) |  <a href="#decision-made">View</a> |
| Case Creation | `cases/creation` | Sent immediately after a case is created | <a href="#case-webhook">View</a> |
| Case Rescore | `cases/rescore` | Sent anytime a case is scored following case creation |  <a href="#case-webhook">View</a> |
| Case Review | `cases/review` | Sent anytime a user assigns a case a Review Disposition (thumbs up/down on console) |  <a href="#case-webhook">View</a> |
| Claim Reviewed | `claim/reviewed` | Sent anytime a request for chargeback reimbursement has been completed |  <a href="#claim-reviewed">View</a> |
| Claim Paid | `claims/paid` | Sent anytime a claim has been paid | <a href="#claim-payouts">View</a> |
| Guarantee Completion | `guarantees/completion` | Deprecated as of January 2021: use the Decision Made event instead. Sent anytime a guarantees decision is made on a case |  <a href="#case-webhook">View</a> |

### Responding to a Webhook
To acknowledge receipt of a webhook, your endpoint should be publicly accessible and return a 2xx HTTP status code. All response codes outside this range, including 3xx codes, will indicate to Signifyd that you did not receive the webhook. This mean that a URL redirection or a "Not Modified" response will be treated as a failure. 

If your endpoint does not successfully receive a webhook we will resend the webhook up to 15 times over four days. The first webhook will be retried after 20s with expotential delays for each subsequent retry. Webhooks cannot be manually retriggered, however you can retrieve the status of a guarantee or case by making a GET request on the applicable resource.

### Verifying a Webhook

To allow a client to verify a webhook message has in fact come from SIGNIFYD, an `X-SIGNIFYD-SEC-HMAC-SHA256` header is included in each webhook POST message. The contents of this header is the Base64 encoded output of the HMAC SHA256 encoding of the JSON body of the message, using the team's API key as the encryption key. To verify the authenticity of the webhook message, you should calculate this value yourself and verify it equals the value contained in the header.

Here's an example of how to compute the value in Java.

`Mac sha256HMAC = javax.crypto.Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(teamAPIKEY.getBytes(), "HmacSHA256");
sha256HMAC.init(secretKey);
String encodedHMAC256 = Base64.encodeBase64String(sha256HMAC.doFinal(jsonBody.getBytes("UTF-8")));`

### Testing a Webhook
Once a webhook is configured, a test POST can be sent by selecting the Test button next to the desired webhook in the Signifyd console settings.
The test webhook message is sent with an HMAC SHA256 verification header (see Webhook Verification below).
The header value is the Base64 encoded output of the HMAC SHA256 encoding of the test webhook JSON body,
using the team API key when available. The test webhook message uses the secret key `ABCDE`. A 'cases/test' topic header is also sent with the test POST.

### Group Device Fingerprint

Signifyd’s device fingerprinting solution uniquely tracks and identifies devices used to transact on your site, increasing your protection from fraud.

### 1. Install the Javascript snippet

Place the following script just before the closing `</head>` tag on all public facing pages. The script loads asynchronously and does not affect page load time.

*We recommend that you load the script on all public user-facing pages. If you are unable to load the script on pages such as payment, login, etc, make sure to have loaded the script at least once before the checkout process is complete.*

```
<script
defer
type="text/javascript"
id="sig-api"
data-order-session-id="YOUR-SESSION-ID-HERE"
src="https://cdn-scripts.signifyd.com/api/script-tag.js"></script>
```

### 2. Provide a unique session id

Replace data-order-session-id with a unique session id for the current user's checkout.

The session id must formatted as followed:
- Less than 128 characters long
- Upper and lowercase English letters (a-z, A-Z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Underscore (_)
- Hyphen (-)

### 3. Send the session id on case creation

After an order is created on your website you will need to add the value you used for `data-order-session-id` to the body of the API POST request to, `https://api.signifiyd.com/v2/cases` under the `purchase` object:

```
// Create a Case
// POST https://api.signifyd.com/v2/cases
// Body
{
    "purchase": {

### Testing the Signifyd device fingerprinting script
During testing you may want to confirm that the Signifyd device fingerprinting script is working correctly. To do so you can call the `SIGNIFYD_GLOBAL.scriptTagHasLoaded()` method which will return a boolean `true|false` value.

Note - *we have namespaced all of the device fingerprinting methods under the `SIGNIFYD_GLOBAL` object to avoid potential naming conflicts.*
